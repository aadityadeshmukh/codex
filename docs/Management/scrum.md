- The concept of Agile can be better understood using a stacey diagram.
- A stacey diagram shows the relationship between degree of certainity and degree of aggreement in a project
- The area in the graph is called a complex zone
- The only way to win in a complex zone is to achieve simplicity and move away from chaos
- Ways to do it?
    - Inspect and adapt
    - Do it frequently
    - Take effective and efficient decisions
- In order to win you need to have 3 things:
    - A framework - Set of basic principles - Example Scrum
    - Strategies - Inifinite - Sprint duration 3hrs
    - Tools and Techniques - Infinite - Jira
- Agile provides a set of values guiding principles for a winning team.
- Typically these are the values that a winning team will value.

![A typical scrum setup](../assets/images/management/scrum-setup.png)

- The Product backlog refinement happens sometime during the current sprint 
- The goal is to discuss the backlog items in terms of acceptance criteria, value etc.
- The backlog is then ready for the Sprint planning
- Product increment does not mean release
- Release strategy is completely dependent on the PO
- Scrum is an empirical process of Plan, do, check, and act activities
