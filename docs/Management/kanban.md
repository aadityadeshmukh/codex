# Kanban

## Understanding Lean Principles

- Kanban \ Lean principles have their roots in Japanese culture \ Automobile manufacturing
- These were adapted and moulded to work with Product development in general
- Kanban means "Signal Cards"
- Its a pull system where the customers will pull the product when needed and workers will create products in appropriate batches and keep the ball rolling
- It prioritizes use of small batches to improve the flow of the work rather than planning and scheduling
- The Kanban board is a signalling device

Five principles of Kanban:
- Visualize workflow
- Limit WIP
- Measure and monitor flow
- Make policies explicit
- Find opportunities for improvement

## Start Enterprise Lean

- Value Stream Mapping:
    - The idea of mapping the whole process and identifying the tasks that add value and rejecting waste
    - Waste: All the things you do that do not add value to the customer
    - While creating a value stream map lay out the entire process
    - Identify areas that can be removed to elimninate waste
- Create a pull system:
    - Create a board which will have typically 5 columns:
        - Input
        - Analyze
        - Develop
        - Test
        - Release
    - Add cards on the board and allow people to pull the cards as per availability
- Determine the demand on the team:
    - Understand what is the current demand
    - Items that are being delivered
    - Based on current demand we can limit WIP
- Determine Capacity:
