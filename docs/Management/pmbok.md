    - societal or environmental positive change
    - improving efficiency, productivity, effectiveness or responsiveness
    - enabling change to help transition to future state
    - sustaining changes from previous programs

    - Working together these components deliver value in line with org strategy
    - Both programs and projects can be standalone
    - Ops can influence and support all the components aling with other functions like payroll
    - Portfolios, programs, projects influence each other as well as ops
    - Components create outcomes (end results) which create benefits which is a net gain for an organization
    - Focus on outcomes, choices, decisions directly proportional to long range performance  
    - The components can be visualized as follows:
