# Prince 2 - Agile - Notes

Introduction
??? info
    - Prince2 Agile describes ways to configure Prince2 to Agile projects
    - Prince2 and Prince2 Agile are meant for projects only.
        - Projects are temporary and differs from BAU work in significant ways:

            | Projects | BAU Work |
            | -------- | -------- |
            | Temporary | Ongoing |
            | Team created | Stable team |
            | Difficult | Routine |
            | Uncertain | Considerable certainity |
        - It is important to understand the distinction as some of the Agile ways need to be applied differently
        - BAU work:
            - Repeatable, routine tasks performed by a technical team without the need of a Project Manager
            - Usually enhancements are made to an existing product
            - Short timelines and steady flow of work and a dedicated team
        - Project:
            - A temporary situation where a team is assembled to address a problem or opportunity
            - Usually such situations cannot be handled as BAU
            - Projects can be a collection of BAU items
            - Highly uncertain
            - Need to engage a lot of stakeholders
            - It may be geographically spread out and might be part of a larger program
            - Above all it needs to be managed by a Project Manager
        - BAU mode operates on fixed timeboxes.
        - Time boxes are finite period when work is carried out to fulfil an objective
        - Deadlines should not be moved. Timeboxes are used to prioritize the work inside the time duration
        - Timeboxes can be of two types: low level(sprints) or high level(stages)

??? note
    - Prince2 treats all agile frameworks as a collection of behaviors, concepts and techniques
    - There are multiple agile frameworks some of which are IT only or are generic.
    - Prince2 treats them as a collection and applies principles on top of it

    | Terms | Examples | Similar Terms |
    | ----- | -------- | ------------- |
    | Behaviors | collaboration, self-organized, trust, blameless | Principles, values, mindset|
    | Concepts | prioritizing what you deliver, reduce waste, inspect and adapt | Fundamentals |
    | Techniques | Burndown chart, user stories, retrospectives | Practices, tools |

Rationale of Prince2 + Agile
??? note
    - Prince2 and Agile tend to complement each other well
    - Prince2 excels in Project Direction and Project Management but weak in project delivery
    - Agile excels in project delivery
    - Thus combining both aspects provide a more holistic approach
    - PRINCE2 Agile provides guidance for tailoring PRINCE2 to work in the most effective way in an agile context.
    - It would be understandable to think that bringing more control and governance into the agile domain could prove counter-productive.
    - However, PRINCE2 Agile represents a marriage that is based on the opposite view: that control and governance allow agile to be used in more situations such as those involving  multiple teams or complex environments.
