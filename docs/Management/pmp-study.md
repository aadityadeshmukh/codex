Introduction

??? info
    - What are process groups?
        - There are 5 process groups:
            - Initiation
            - Planning
            - Execution
            - Monitoring and control
            - Closure
        - Process groups are not to be confused with a lifecycle
        - They are containers of individual processes & distinct ways of managing projects based on knowledge necessary
        - Important point to note is projects are "temporary" & "unique". These are their main characteristics
    
    - Knowledge areas overview:
        - Knowledge areas are specific concepts that are needed to be understood for each project
        - They can be different for different projects
        - But a Project Manager needs to understand which knowledge areas are needed for their work
        - For example some projects might only need scope, schedule and cost
        - There are a total of 10 knowledge areas which have processes, input, tools, techniques and outputs
        - The knowledge areas might have processes spread accross multiple process groups
        - A project manager must consider each of these knowledge areas before initiation to determine which one of these need to be planned, executed, monitored and controlled
    
    - Knowledge areas:
        - 1 **Integration management**
            - It is the area where a comprehensive project management plan is created
            - It involves creating a charter, deliverables, deciding where the monitoring and control happens, where formal change control lies and where closure occurs
            - *Integrate*: All the chosen knowledge areas must integrate correctly 
        - 2 **Scope management**
            - Co-ordination of requirement collection for both project and product, determining how the scope of work and how the work will be completed and formal deliverable sign-off
            - It is about ensuring the work is completed as expected by the stakeholders
            - It is the act of ensuring you have the right tools, techniques and resources to complete the deliverable
            - Scope of work is critical and it influences schedules, budgets and resource assignments
        - 3 **Schedule management**
            - Answers the question: "How long will the project take?"
            - Involves:
                - creating a sequence
                - determining the resources needed to complete the task in a sequence and within assumed duration
                - Produce a schedule that we can meet
        - 4 **Cost management**
            - Estimating costs
            - Budgeting costs
            - Controlling costs
        - 5 **Quality management**
            - Its about building the thing right and fit for use
            - Scope management is about building the right thing
        - 6 **Resource management**
            - Managing people, equipment and material
            - Involves team management and allocation of resources
        - 7 **Communication management**
            - Involves creating a communication plan
            - To get the right information to the right people at the right time and in the right format
            - The communication needs to be planned to get the maximum impact
        - 8 **Risk management**
            - This is about protecting project work, budgets, schedules etc.
            - Two main types: Threats & opportunities
            - The area deals with analyzing the risks and creating a response plan
        - 9 **Procurement management**
            - Contracts and aggreements with vendors
        - 10 **Stakeholder management**
            - Stakeholders are the ones who have significant interest or influence on the project
            - Their expectations need to be managed
            - Effective communication is key to achieve this
        - Stakeholder engagement and Communication management work hand in hand but we need to think of it functionally.
        - Communication is about information and getting it to the right people
        - Stakeholder engagement is about relationships
    
    - Processes:
        - There are a total of 49 processes
        - Each process correspond to one or more knowledge area & one or more process groups
        - Each process has a ITTO: *input*, *tools*, *techniques* & *output*
    
    - What are ITTOs?
        - They answer the following questions:
            - What do I need before I can make X? --> Inputs
            - What will I use to do X? --> Tools & Techniques
            - What will I have when I am finished? --> outputs
    
    - OPAs (Organizational process assets) and EEFs (Enterprise environmental factors):
        - These are the most common inputs and updated outputs in the processes also called influences
        - It refers to process and environment i.e. what your organization does and who your organization is
        - The consideration for your current org process and environment must be considered for any process
        - "Anything absolute in project management is regulation, not standards, or best practice" 
        - EEFs:
            - Internal
                - Organizational culture, structure, and governance
                - Geographic location and distribution of facilities and resources
                - Infrastructure
                - Information technology software
                - Availability of resources
                - Employee capability, skills, and specialized knowledge
            - External
                - Marketplace conditions
                - Social and cultural influences and issues
                - Legal restrictions
                - Commercial databases
                - Industry studies, publications, and benchmarking results
                - Government or industry standards/regulations
                - Financial considerations for inflation rates, exchange rates, tariffs, and geographic locations
                - Physical environmental elements such as weather and working conditions
        - OPAs:
            - Plans, policies, or knowledge of all performing organizations (yours or your customer's)
            - Processes, policies, and procedures
            - Organizational knowledge bases
            - All can be established by the Project Management Office (PMO) or some other driving process from outside of your organization.
    
    - Project management plan & project documents:
        - There are numerous documents that a project manager must handle
        - These need to be updated via change control or regular iterative updates
        - There are certain rules based on the type of documents
        - Input / Output rules:
            - Inputs are documents that are key to the process
            - Outputs can be inputs to another process unless they are terminal or embedded into other inputs
            - Inputs should be an output of a process unless its external
        - Project Document rules:
            - They are called "Project document updates" if output in section narrative
            - They are called "Project document" if input in the section narrative
        - Project Management plan rules
        - Sequencing rules
        - Rules for handling tools and techniques

Pre-project Initiation

??? info
    What is a project?

    - A project is temporary and unique. This is the best definition of what a project is.
        - Imagine you need to build a website for a department for internal use
        - They will be the key stakeholders and will have specific requirements, budget and timelines
        - Once the website is built to spec it will be handed over to the department and they will confirm or suggest changes
        - The project will close once handed over
        - This is essentially the entire cycle of the project:
            - Initiation
            - Planning and execution
            - Monitoring and control
            - Formal closure
        - Post closure if the website needs more features this will be a *fresh new project*
    - Another important way to describe a project is *progressive elaboration*
    - All projects create business value (tangible or non-tangible)
        - Tangible:
            - Stockholder value
            - Market share
            - Tools
            - Other monetary assets
        - Non Tangible:
            - Brand recognition
            - Trademarks
            - Reputation
            - Goodwill
    - Most common reason a company would undertake a project are due to legal, social or regulatory requirements
    - Specific factors that lead to project creation:
        - New technology
        - Competitive forces
        - Material issues
        - Political changes
        - Market demand
        - Economic changes
        - Customer requests
        - Stakeholder demands
        - Legal requirement
        - Business process improvements
        - Strategic business opportunities or business need
        - Social need
        - Environmental considerations
    
    What is a program?
        - A program is a set of related projects that are run in a co-ordinated way
        - Orgs run programs because they have a set group of best practices or processes that can be utilized on all of them
    
    What is a portfolio?
        - A portfolio is a set of unrelated programs and projects
        - Project and Program management is interested in completing the projects the right way
        - Portfolio management is about determining the right projects or programs to initiate based on business needs

    **What is project Management?**

    - In general, it is the project manager's job to utilize a set of best practices, tools and techniques, excellent communication, and coordination of all the moving parts to bring the result to successful completion.
    - Most best practices are related to cost, schedule and scope
    - Types of project management:
        - Predictive or waterfall project management
            - The end result is known or predicted
            - The expected outcome is known
            - There is a formal change control
            - Requirements dont change midway
            - Solutions are formulated, communicated and approved before implementation
            - Plans are created well in advance
        - Adaptive or agile project management
            - The outcome is not known
            - Change is welcome
            - Teams are only 1 to 4 weeks into the cycle
            - No front loaded planning. Decisions are taken at the last responsible moment
    - Project Management lifecycles:
        - There are a few types of project lifecycles that can be applied depending on the project:
            - Predictive
                - Scope, budget, schedules are decided early on
            - Iterative
                - Scope is decided early but schedule and budgets are modified later
                - Develop the product in repeated cycles
            - Incremental
                - Deliverables are added in iterations within a timeframe
            - Adaptive
                - Detailed scope is defined and approved before the iteration
                - Highly change driven
            - Hybrid
                - Combination of predictive or adaptive 
    - Project phases:
        - Each project will have a few phases
        - Phases are a logical collection of activities that will produce a deliverable
        - Phases may have these or more attributes:
            - Name: Phase 1, 2 etc
            - Number: Total phases
            - Duration: Set or expected duration
            - Resource requirements: Required resources people, equipment
            - Entrance criteria
            - Exit criteria
        - Each phase will have gates which are basically ways to determine if one phase ends and other is supposed to start
        - Its a way to decide how far we are in the lifecycle and what phase we are in
        - It allows us to consider the preventive and corrective actions needed to be taken to reach the next phase
    - Project Management data and information:
        - *Work performance data*
            - Raw data collected from members e.g. "How much time did you spend on it?"
            - The project manager gets this information and plugs them in the PMIS
        - *Work performance information*
            - The data is used to compare with original plan which generates information like scope, schedule, costs
            - If the numbers are outside the planned limits then adaptive actions can be taken
            - Information can also be used to forecast performance
        - *Work performace reports*
            - The information collected is communicated to stakeholders
    - Project Selection techniques:
        -   Why companies undertake projects?:
            - Market demand
            - Customer request
            - Business need or opportunity
            - Technical advances
            - Legal compliance
            - Environment considerations
            - Social need
        - Businesses need to validate the reasons to undertake the project
        - The project must fit into the organizations strategic plan
        - Business case is the main driver for the pre-project initiation.
        - Creating a business case:
            - Business analysts are involved during pre-project initiation
            - They analyse the data and consider multiple financial models to determine ROI
            - However, this is predictive and mostly has holes in it
            - We might have a better chance to come close to the numbers when the project is planned and understood
            - Hence a project manager might be involved in the selection process
            - Analysis:
                - Used to narrow the gap between crunched and actual numbers
                - Types:
                    - Decision models
                        - Cost-benefit analysis
                        - Scoring models
                        - Payback period
                    - Economic models
                        - Discounted Cash flow
                            - Determining the future financial return worth
                            - Process:
                                - Find the payback period
                                - Apply the discount rates and inflation
                                - Assumed amount of money the organization will recieve overall
                        - Net present value
                            - Net gain or loss in each timeframe
                            - NPV analysis is the process of taking expenditures, net gains, and net losses for each potential year in an attempt to determine whether the project will return enough net revenue to keep up with the cost of capital over time.
                            - ==**Tip**: Always choose the highest NPV==
                        - Internal Rate of Return
                            - IRR allows to calculate return without any external factors like inflation or cost of capital
                            - It considers time value of money
                            - ==**Tip: Always consider projects with highest IRR==
                        - ==**Tip**: Typically for exam the NPV is the key indicator of a profitable project==
                    - Constrained optimization
                        - These are mathematical models used to determine project viability or profitable
                    - Expert judgement
                        - Utilize opnions from experts and stakeholders to determine projects
                        - Downside is groupthink which can be avoided by using the other models
                    - Feasibility analysis
                        - Using expert judgement to determine feasibility in addition to financial ROI
                - Business case:
                        - The business case is the very first document that will be created
                        - It is comprehensive
                        - It includes the executive summary first but is usually written last
                        - The following header will also be included:
                            - Issues that the project is addressing
                            - The anticipated outcomes
                            - Any recommendations from the selection committee
                            - The business case analysis team
                            - The problem definition and statement that describes why the project is under consideration
                            - The organizational impact of the project
                            - Technology implementations
                            - Project overview and description
                            - Goals and objectives
                            - Expected project performance
                            - Any assumptions or constraints
                            - Major milestones
                            - Strategic alignment
                            - Cost-benefit analysis
                            - Alternatives analysis
                            - Approval signatures
            - Stakeholders:

                        - Oversee resources, mehodologies, tools and techniques
                        - Three types:
                            - Supportive
                            - Controlling

                    - Customers/end users
            - Organizational Structures:
                - There are many structures but the 2 main types are as follows:
                    - Functional
                        - The manager of each department is incharge not the project manager
                        - The project manager role might be temporary
                        - Someone in the department is assigned to expedite the process but not given actual designation
                    - Matrix
                        - Weak Matrix
                            - Operates in a functional, hierarchical design
                        - Balanced Matrix
                            - The balanced matrix emphasizes an equal focus on operational, functional work, and project work.
                        - Strong Matrix
                            - The core project team helps the project manager plan and execute the work
                            - The project manager and project team are full time.
                    - Projectized
                        - The project manager has full authority.

                | Functional | Weak Matrix | Balanced Matrix | Strong Matrix | Projectized |
                | ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
                | No power   | Limited Power | Some Power | Incharge of project | Complete control |
                | Functional manager in charge   | Functional manager in charge | Functional manager in charge | Incharge but may borrow resources | Complete control of resources |
                | Expediter   | Co-ordinator | Co-ordinator | Project Manager | Project Manager |
