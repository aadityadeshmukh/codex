    - What are process groups?
        - There are 5 process groups:
            - Initiation
            - Planning
            - Execution
            - Monitoring and control
            - Closure
        - Process groups are not to be confused with a lifecycle
        - They are containers of individual processes & distinct ways of managing projects based on knowledge necessary
        - Important point to note is projects are "temporary" & "unique". These are their main characteristics
    
    - Knowledge areas overview:
        - Knowledge areas are specific concepts that are needed to be understood for each project
        - They can be different for different projects
        - But a Project Manager needs to understand which knowledge areas are needed for their work
        - For example some projects might only need scope, schedule and cost
        - There are a total of 10 knowledge areas which have processes, input, tools, techniques and outputs
        - The knowledge areas might have processes spread accross multiple process groups
        - A project manager must consider each of these knowledge areas before initiation to determine which one of these need to be planned, executed, monitored and controlled
    
    - Knowledge areas:
        - 1 **Integration management**
            - It is the area where a comprehensive project management plan is created
            - It involves creating a charter, deliverables, deciding where the monitoring and control happens, where formal change control lies and where closure occurs
            - *Integrate*: All the chosen knowledge areas must integrate correctly 
        - 2 **Scope management**
            - Co-ordination of requirement collection for both project and product, determining how the scope of work and how the work will be completed and formal deliverable sign-off
            - It is about ensuring the work is completed as expected by the stakeholders
            - It is the act of ensuring you have the right tools, techniques and resources to complete the deliverable
            - Scope of work is critical and it influences schedules, budgets and resource assignments
        - 3 **Schedule management**
            - Answers the question: "How long will the project take?"
            - Involves:
                - creating a sequence
                - determining the resources needed to complete the task in a sequence and within assumed duration
                - Produce a schedule that we can meet
        - 4 **Cost management**
            - Estimating costs
            - Budgeting costs
            - Controlling costs
        - 5 **Quality management**
            - Its about building the thing right and fit for use
            - Scope management is about building the right thing
        - 6 **Resource management**
            - Managing people, equipment and material
            - Involves team management and allocation of resources
        - 7 **Communication management**
            - Involves creating a communication plan
            - To get the right information to the right people at the right time and in the right format
            - The communication needs to be planned to get the maximum impact
        - 8 **Risk management**
            - This is about protecting project work, budgets, schedules etc.
            - Two main types: Threats & opportunities
            - The area deals with analyzing the risks and creating a response plan
        - 9 **Procurement management**
            - Contracts and aggreements with vendors
        - 10 **Stakeholder management**
            - Stakeholders are the ones who have significant interest or influence on the project
            - Their expectations need to be managed
            - Effective communication is key to achieve this
        - Stakeholder engagement and Communication management work hand in hand but we need to think of it functionally.
        - Communication is about information and getting it to the right people
        - Stakeholder engagement is about relationships
    
    - Processes:
        - There are a total of 49 processes
        - Each process correspond to one or more knowledge area & one or more process groups
        - Each process has a ITTO: *input*, *tools*, *techniques* & *output*
    
    - What are ITTOs?
        - They answer the following questions:
            - What do I need before I can make X? --> Inputs
            - What will I use to do X? --> Tools & Techniques
            - What will I have when I am finished? --> outputs
    
    - OPAs (Organizational process assets) and EEFs (Enterprise environmental factors):
        - These are the most common inputs and updated outputs in the processes also called influences
        - It refers to process and environment i.e. what your organization does and who your organization is
        - The consideration for your current org process and environment must be considered for any process
        - "Anything absolute in project management is regulation, not standards, or best practice" 
        - EEFs:
            - Internal
                - Organizational culture, structure, and governance
                - Geographic location and distribution of facilities and resources
                - Infrastructure
                - Information technology software
                - Availability of resources
                - Employee capability, skills, and specialized knowledge
            - External
                - Marketplace conditions
                - Social and cultural influences and issues
                - Legal restrictions
                - Commercial databases
                - Industry studies, publications, and benchmarking results
                - Government or industry standards/regulations
                - Financial considerations for inflation rates, exchange rates, tariffs, and geographic locations
                - Physical environmental elements such as weather and working conditions
        - OPAs:
            - Plans, policies, or knowledge of all performing organizations (yours or your customer's)
            - Processes, policies, and procedures
            - Organizational knowledge bases
            - All can be established by the Project Management Office (PMO) or some other driving process from outside of your organization.
    
    - Project management plan & project documents:
        - There are numerous documents that a project manager must handle
        - These need to be updated via change control or regular iterative updates
        - There are certain rules based on the type of documents
        - Input / Output rules:
            - Inputs are documents that are key to the process
            - Outputs can be inputs to another process unless they are terminal or embedded into other inputs
            - Inputs should be an output of a process unless its external
        - Project Document rules:
            - They are called "Project document updates" if output in section narrative
            - They are called "Project document" if input in the section narrative
        - Project Management plan rules
        - Sequencing rules
        - Rules for handling tools and techniques

Pre-project Initiation

    What is a project?

    - A project is temporary and unique. This is the best definition of what a project is.
        - Imagine you need to build a website for a department for internal use
        - They will be the key stakeholders and will have specific requirements, budget and timelines
        - Once the website is built to spec it will be handed over to the department and they will confirm or suggest changes
        - The project will close once handed over
        - This is essentially the entire cycle of the project:
            - Initiation
            - Planning and execution
            - Monitoring and control
            - Formal closure
        - Post closure if the website needs more features this will be a *fresh new project*
    - Another important way to describe a project is *progressive elaboration*
    - All projects create business value (tangible or non-tangible)
        - Tangible:
            - Stockholder value
            - Market share
            - Tools
            - Other monetary assets
        - Non Tangible:
            - Brand recognition
            - Trademarks
            - Reputation
            - Goodwill
    - Most common reason a company would undertake a project are due to legal, social or regulatory requirements
    - Specific factors that lead to project creation:
        - New technology
        - Competitive forces
        - Material issues
        - Political changes
        - Market demand
        - Economic changes
        - Customer requests
        - Stakeholder demands
        - Legal requirement
        - Business process improvements
        - Strategic business opportunities or business need
        - Social need
        - Environmental considerations
    
    What is a program?
        - A program is a set of related projects that are run in a co-ordinated way
        - Orgs run programs because they have a set group of best practices or processes that can be utilized on all of them
    
    What is a portfolio?
        - A portfolio is a set of unrelated programs and projects
        - Project and Program management is interested in completing the projects the right way
        - Portfolio management is about determining the right projects or programs to initiate based on business needs

    **What is project Management?**
    - In general, it is the project manager's job to utilize a set of best practices, tools and techniques, excellent communication, and coordination of all the moving parts to bring the result to successful completion.
    - Most best practices are related to cost, schedule and scope

        - Predictive or waterfall project management
            - The end result is known or predicted
            - The expected outcome is known
            - There is a formal change control
            - Requirements dont change midway
            - Solutions are formulated, communicated and approved before implementation
            - Plans are created well in advance
        - Adaptive or agile project management
            - The outcome is not known
            - Change is welcome
            - Teams are only 1 to 4 weeks into the cycle
